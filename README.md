## Extra notes

- This project is purely a practical exercise intended for developing and/or showcasing my skills in the tools/techniques/concepts mentioned above. It's not meant to be a complete production-ready solution. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or simply want to chat about it!
- This exercise was built following the lessons from [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/)'s Ignite ReactJS program. It may or may not have been adapted/redesigned by me.
